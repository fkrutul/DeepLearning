1. Get client ID and client Secret from "Spotify for developers" by following the link above. Replace them accordingly in the python code. 

2. Install "Spotify artist's all songs" extension for Chrome: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/spotify-artists-all-songs/jdicfniianljldbajoghhnilmnghgmno

3. Go to Spotify web player and search an artist. Click the artist's page, then activate the "Spotify artist's all songs" extension and click "Show all songs". Notice that the URL will change once the song list is updated. Copy the ID following the last "/" in the URL and paste it into the code, and change the filename.

4. To find artists from specific country, google "singers list" and the country name. You'll find a Wikipedia page listing most singers from that county. I prefer to randomly select singers so that the popularities are relatively widely distributed (except USA singers which are from the most famous singers' list).
